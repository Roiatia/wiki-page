  <h2>Cars</h2>
  <p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they
    run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.

    Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded
    as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
  <p>Cars became widely
    available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an
    American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.
  </p>
  <p>Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced
    animal-drawn carriages and carts.[ In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase
    until after World War II.
  </p>

    Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional
    features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include
    rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the
    early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars,
    which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to
    cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025. The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features
    prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for
    climate change.

    There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest
    payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes,
    and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public
    health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of
    injury-related deaths worldwide.

    Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. Societal benefits
    include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision,
    societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. People's ability to
    move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies. There are around 1
    billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly
    industrialized countries.</p>

  <h3 id="history"> History</h3>
  <p> The first working steam-powered vehicle was designed—and quite possibly built—by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish
    member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre (26 in)-long scale-model toy for the Kangxi
    Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger. It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was
    successfully built or run.

  <p>
    Large-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile
    factory in Lansing, Michigan and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at
    the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts
    had been pioneered in the U.S. by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield,
    Massachusetts. This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world's first moving
    assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.

    Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort, and safety, normally operated by a combination
    of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 21st-century cars. These controls include a steering
    wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch
    pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights,
    ventilation, and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardized, such as the location for the
    accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for
    example, the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.

    Some of the original controls are no longer required. For example, all cars once had controls for the choke valve,
    clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However new controls have also been added to
    vehicles, making them more complex. These include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment.
    Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such
    as BMW's iDrive and Ford's MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to
    the brake mechanism and throttle, in the early 2020s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with
    electronic controls.

  <P>
    Cars are typically equipped with interior lighting which can be toggled manually or be set to light up with
    automatically doors open, an entertainment system which originated from car radios, sideways windows which can be
    lowered or raised electrically (manually on earlier cars), and one or multiple auxiliary power outlets for supplying
    portable appliances such as mobile phones, portable fridges, power inverters, and electrical air pumps from the
    on-board electrical system. More costly upper-class and luxury cars are equipped with features earlier
    such as massage seats and collision avoidance systems.

    Dedicated automotive fuses and circuit breakers prevent damage from electrical overload.
